# Large Language Model Project: Question-Answering System for Website

This repository contains a Large Language Model project focused on building a
Question-Answering System tailored for querying a specific website. The aim of
this project is to develop an intelligent system that can understand user
queries and provide relevant answers based on the content available on the
website.

## Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to leverage the power of large language
models to create a robust Question-Answering System. By utilizing advanced
techniques in natural language processing and machine learning, we aim to enable
users to ask questions and obtain meaningful responses directly from the
website.

## Steps Involved

To achieve our goal, we have broken down the project into the following key
steps:

1. **Web Scraping**: We will scrape the website's content, extracting webpages
   and relevant information from the target website.

2. **Embeddings Generation**: The extracted webpages will undergo an embeddings
   generation process, where numerical representations capturing the semantic
   meaning of the text will be created. These embeddings will allow us to
   measure the similarity between user queries and the website content.

3. **Query Processing**: When a user submits a query, we will generate
   embeddings for the query text. This step ensures that both the query and the
   website content are represented in a compatible format for comparison.

4. **Comparison and Retrieval**: By comparing the embeddings of the user query
   with the embeddings of the website content, we can identify the most
   relevant webpages based on their semantic similarity. This process will
   facilitate the retrieval of the most suitable information to answer the
   user's query.

5. **Context Injection**: Once we identify the most relevant webpage(s) based on
   the query, we will inject the content of those webpages as context into the
   prompt for the large language model. This contextual information will enable
   the model to generate accurate and meaningful responses.

6. **Response Generation**: With the context injected, the large language model
   will process the user query along with the relevant webpage content to
   generate a response. The response will provide the most relevant and
   informative answer to the user's query.

We believe that this project will greatly enhance the accessibility and
usability of the website's information by providing users with an intuitive and
efficient question-answering system. We invite you to explore the repository,
contribute to its development, and witness the power of large language models
in action.
